# Project Brief: AntiGravity MERN Starter

## 🚀 Vision
**AntiGravity** is a modern, scalable, and "Agentic-First" boilerplate for building Multi-Tenant SaaS applications. It transcends typical "starter kits" by treating AI Agents (like you) as first-class citizens in the development lifecycle.

## 🎯 Core Objectives
1.  **Multi-Tenancy**: Native support for "Owners" (Global) and "Staff" (Store-Scoped).
2.  **Scalability**: Modular Monolith architecture that allows features to grow independently.
3.  **Developer Experience**: strict Typescript, Zod validation contracts, and automated testing.
4.  **AI Compatibility**: A documentation structure designed to be parsable, atomic, and unambiguous for LLMs.

## 🏗️ The "Genre"
*   **Type**: SaaS / POS (Point of Sale) System.
*   **Vibe**: Premium, Fast, and "Heavy-duty" but light to use.
*   **Philosophy**: "Strict Contracts, Loose Coupling." Frontend and Backend share types but never implementation details.

## 👥 Intended Audience
*   **Developers**: Who want a production-ready MERN stack without the setup fatigue.
*   **Businesses**: Who need a multi-store management system out of the box.
*   **Agents**: Who need a clean, structured environment to write code without guessing context.
