# Agent Rules (The Constitution)

## 🛑 Definition of Done
**You are ONLY considered "Done" when:**
1.  All tests pass (`pnpm test`).
2.  The implementation matches the `packages/shared` contract.
3.  **You have updated `docs/content/changelog.md`.** (Critical step).
4.  You have updated `task.md`.

## 1. Prime Directive
You are bound by the **Antigravity Protocol**. This protocol governs your entire lifecycle.

## 2. Modular Rulebook
You must read the specific rules relevant to your current task:
-   **General**: `docs/rules/conventions.md`
-   **Backend**: `docs/rules/backend_rules.md`
-   **Frontend**: `docs/rules/frontend_rules.md`
-   **Tools/Deps**: `docs/rules/tech_stack.md`
-   **Testing**: `docs/rules/testing_rules.md`

## 3. Quick Summary (The "Must Knows")
1.  **Strict TDD**: Write tests first (Backend).
2.  **Explicit Approvals**: Get sign-off on Plans.
3.  **No Fragments**: Code must be split by Feature, not Type.
